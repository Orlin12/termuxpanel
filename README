This is my custom made Minecraft server panel for Termux, this project was uploaded for the people of TikTok to be able to download and use for
their own personal uses, do not edit the code and make it your own, however I cannot stop you. No assistance will be provided for those who edited the code.

JAVA MUST BE INSTALLED FOR THE SERVER TO RUN
READ: The "start_minecraft.sh" file contains the code needed to start the server, please replace the code in it with your requirements (e.g the directory and the run command for java)

The steps to running the panel are as follows:

1. Unzip the node_modules folder in the root directory of the panel
2. Make sure node is installed on the host machine
3. Put the contents of the Minecraft server in the "minecraft" directory, the jar file should be in the root of the minecraft directory.
4. Run the following command in the root of the panel's folder to start the web panel: node server.js
5. Access the web panel via: http://yourphonesip:8080  (replace yourphonesip with the ip address of the device it's running on)
6. Enjoy the panel, terminal output will be displayed on the page, and you can start/stop the server via the buttons provided.
